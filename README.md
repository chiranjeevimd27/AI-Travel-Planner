# AI-Powered Travel Planner

## **Objective**
Develop an AI-powered travel planner that generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences. The system will use prompt engineering and web-search tools to curate travel recommendations and will be hosted on a free platform like Streamlit or Gradio.

## **Features**
- Extract user preferences such as budget, trip duration, destination, and interests.
- Chain prompts to refine inputs and enhance personalization.
- Fetch real-time travel recommendations using web-search tools.
- Generate structured, day-by-day travel itineraries.
- Deploy the system for live user testing.

## **Implementation Steps**
### **1. Understanding User Context**
- Identify user needs from input messages.
- Ask follow-up questions for incomplete details.
- Structure responses based on user constraints (e.g., budget, preferred activities).

### **2. Building the Prompt System**
- **System Prompt:** Extracts core travel details.
- **User Prompt Refinement:** Gathers additional user preferences.
- **Activity Suggestions:** Uses web tools to find top attractions aligned with user interests.
- **Final Itinerary Generation:** Creates a well-structured itinerary.

### **3. Deliverables**
- **Prompts & Responses:**
  - Labeled as System Prompt, User Prompt, and Model Response.
- **Sample Outputs:**
  - Curated travel recommendations based on user inputs.
  - Detailed travel itineraries.
- **Documentation:**
  - Explanation of the prompt design and reasoning.
- **Deployment:**
  - Hosted on Streamlit or Gradio, with a link provided for testing.

## **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**
- Enhance flexibility in user input handling.
- Improve refinement of vague or incomplete inputs.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
1. **Prompt Design:** Clarity, specificity, and structure.
2. **Prompt Chaining:** Logical flow and strategic refinement.
3. **Personalization:** Alignment with user preferences.
4. **Documentation:** Explanation of the process and design decisions.

## **Estimated Time**
- **Prompt Design & Testing:** 3-4 hours
- **AI Agent Development:** 3-4 hours
- **Hosting & Deployment:** 1-2 hours
- **Documentation:** <1 hour
